Insite - Map Visualization
======================
Take a CSV and turn it into spots on a map.  Spots can vary in size and color.  Size and color can be assigned to different columns from the CSV (I'm calling them measures) to visualize the different sets of data.  Data to be visualized can be numeric or yes/no/maybe data - any data that are not of that format will show up as general metadata assigned to a place.

Also has the ability to pull in "measures" from APIs.
